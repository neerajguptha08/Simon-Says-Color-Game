# Simon-Says-Color-Game
A simple and interactive memory game inspired by "Simon Says." Test your memory and reflexes as you follow a sequence of flashing colors. Each level adds a new color to the sequence, challenging you to recall and repeat the pattern. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is perfect for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation.
